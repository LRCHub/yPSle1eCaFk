Sugar girl
Worked at the dollar store
She worked her tail right off
She had these bright blue eyes
She dreamed in staggering size
One day a big black car
Big man with a big fat cigar
Looking for aspirin
All night with woman and gin
He said baby what's your name
Nothing that can't be changed
Baby what's your age
Oh don't you ever say
She said as the sun
As ever the moon
You put it together
I am twilight
As ever I'm black
As ever I'm white
You put me together I am twilight
Hey your a beautiful girl
Don't you know I rule the world
I can make you a star
I can take you real far
That camera's for making love
You smile and don't say a word
I'll be the one that talks You be the one that walks
And shake those curvy hips
Kiss with those cherry lips
You've got a very sexy way
Sugar girl Is your new name
She said as the sun
As ever the moon
You put it together
I am twilight
As ever I'm black
As ever I'm white
You put me together I am twilight
She lit up
From the whole ride
Through the photographs
She lit up
She's the face of the day
She's known for being that way
Every man wants a part
Its what all women want
Sugar girl
Your a diva
The press would really like to know
Do you adore yourself
Like all the rest of us do
She said as the sun
As ever the moon
You put it together
I am twilight
As ever I'm black
As ever I'm white
You put me together I am twilight
As ever I'm dark
As ever I"m white You put me together
I am twilight
I am twilight
I am twilight
