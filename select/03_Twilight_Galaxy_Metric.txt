Did they tell you, you should grow up
When you wanted to dream.
Did they warn you, better shape up
If you want to succeed
I don't know about you, who are they talking to?
They aren't talking to me.
I'm higher than high
Lower than deep,
I'm doing it wrong
And singing along
Go higher than high, lower than deep
Keep doing it wrong and singing along
Did I ask you for attention
When affection is what I need
Thinking sorrow is perfection,
I'd wallow 'til you told me
There's no glitter in the gutter,
There's no twilight galaxy.
Go higher than high, oh
Lower than deep, oh
Keep doing it wrong, oh
Singing along, oh
I'm higher than high, oh
Lower than deep, oh
Doing it wrong, oh
And singing along, oh
I'm alright, c'mon baby
I've seen all the demons that you've got.
If you're not alright, now c'mon baby
I'll pick you up and take you where you want
Anywhere you want
Anywhere you want
Anywhere you want
Anything you want
I'm higher than high, oh
Lower than deep, oh
Doing it wrong, oh
And singing along, oh
Higher than high, oh
Lower than deep, oh
Doing it wrong, oh
Singing along, oh
