What do you know about the ancient,
What do you know about the future
Why these serious questions,
Why not forget directions.

What do you know about the ancient,
What do you know about the future

Why not forget directions, for awhile

Let's reach twilight
Sun, winter premiere
For a day, tonight to lay

What do you know about the ancient,
What do you know about the future
Why these serious questions,
Why not forget directions

What do you know about the ancient,
What do you know about the future
Why these serious questions,
Why not forget directions

For awhile
One day, tonight to lay
(For awhile, for awhile)

Between beauty and dreams
(Twilight)

Twilight, Twilight, Twilight
Twilight, Twilight, Twilight
